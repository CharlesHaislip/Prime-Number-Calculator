# Prime-Number-Calculator
This is a prime number finer created in VBA. I'll prbably reprogram this from the ground up. It's a bit buggy. It's licenced under the GPL, so go nuts if you want to fix them. This was a first project for me, so you me see some rambling comments in the code. I did my best to remove them before making the repository public. This has been tested to work on windows. Open the solution in Visual Studio (Not Visual Studio Code) And it should run just fine. Please note that the prime numbers, when you save them, are in plain text. No, when I did this project, I did not know how to serialize the array. But for the most part it works, if slow. Iam well aware there are bad programming practices in the code, and that is something that I would fix by rebuilding the entire application from the ground up in a second project.
